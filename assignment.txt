Web Scraping Intern: Assignment

Here’s a short and simple assignment to be completed before you join us!

The assignment goal is to basically make a script to scrape data from the website https://coinmarketcap.com/


TASK: Write a script (name of the script should be main.py) which has two functions get_coins() and get_coin_data(coin) 


GET COINS

You need to create a function with the name get_coins which gets the name, symbol and url for the first 50 coins listed on https://coinmarketcap.com/coins/ . This data then needs to be stored in a CSV file - coins.csv with columns: 

SNo		Name		Symbol 		  URL	  	
Eg->	     1		  Bitcoin		BTC		coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/ 
This data is to be scraped using BeautifulSoup module only. You’re NOT allowed to use Selenium for this function.


GET_COIN_DATA

You need to create a function with the name get_coin_data which accepts a parameter coin_symbol which is the symbol of the coin whose data needs to be scraped. 

Function signature - def get_coin_data(coin_symbol):
You need to read the coin URL from the coins.csv file (generated by get_coins function) and scrape the following data(see pics at the end of doc for reference):
Symbol	
Name	
WatchlistCount	
Website URL
Circulating Supply %
Price
Volume / Market Cap
Market Dominance
Rank
Market Cap 
All Time High - DATE
All Time High - PRICE
All Time Low  - DATE
All Time Low  - PRICE
What is <Coin Name>?
Who are the founders?
What makes it unique?
You may use either BeautifulSoup or Selenium in this function.
The data needs to be appended as a row(in the same order) in CSV file: coins_data.csv :
